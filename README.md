# Advent of Code 2021

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This year I am participating in Advent of Code mostly for personal enjoyment, but I did use it in my Python class.
